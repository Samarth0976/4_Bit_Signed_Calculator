4 Bit Scientific Calculator Using Xilinx ISE 14.7(Verilog) on Spartan 6 FPGA Dev Board
Intro
A calculator's function is to do accurate calculations in a timely manner. It is obvious that, to the greatest extent feasible, a calculator should free the user from the need to do mental calculations and rely on paper.
Scientific calculators are extensively employed in circumstances where quick access to certain mathematical functions is required, particularly those that were previously looked up in mathematical tables, such as trigonometric functions and logarithms.
They're also employed in astronomy, physics, and chemistry to calculate extremely large or extremely small values.
For scientific computations a simple modern day calculator cannot be used, here is when a Scientific Calculator comes into picture. We are designing a scientific calculator using Verilog HDL.
